The CommuncationListening of the Communcation Manager can be enabled in the ingame Settings.

There the following settings are existing:
-- Enable Socket Listening (Let the CommunicationManager listen for incoming calls)
-- Password (Password which get used to encrypt and decrypt the messages for the openssl connection)
-- Listening port for every server (this is the port the CommunicationManager listens at)


For the description of the available implemented communcation Methods check the CommunicationMethods interface.

If you need methods which are not implemented, or additional Parameters, feel free to contact us.

Sample ManiaControl Implementation (for ManiaControl to ManiaControl connections)

##php code begin
	//This Sample shows just the Implementation of the Method GET_SERVER_CHAT

	//Caller Side
	$communication = $this->maniaControl->getCommunicationManager()->createCommunication(IP/Domain, PORT, 'YOUR_PASSWORD');
	$communication->call(function($data){
		//$data includes the data sent by the Website / other Controller
	   return new CommunicationAnswer($data); //send data back
	}, CommunicationMethods::GET_SERVER_CHAT);

	//Callee Side
	$this->maniaControl->getCommunicationManager()->registerCommunicationListener(CommunicationMethods::GET_SERVER_CHAT, $this, function ($data) {
   	   return new CommunicationAnswer($this->chatBuffer);
  	});
##php code end
