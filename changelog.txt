###v0.16###

#Additions
- added changelog
- added SocketManager which acts like a communication interface you can connect to and interact with ManiaControl (also thanks to TGYoshi for some help)
- added "//removerights login" command
- added new EchoManager which handles Interactions between different Controllers
	- It is possible to send an Echo command via the Method sendEcho, as message Parameter strings, objects or arrays can get used
	- An EchoListener can be added, callable by closure or implicit use (like on callbacks)
	- The Listener always returns either an Stringer or an Object back as Param (arrays get converted into objects)
	- On sending an Echo Message from another controller you need to provide an string to the dedicated method or an json_encoded array or object
	- 4 Echos are Implemented by ManiaControl (ManiaControl.Restart, ManiaControl.AuthenticationManager.GrandLevel, ManiaControl.AuthenticationManager.RevokeLevel, ManiaControl.PlayerManager.WarnPlayer)
- added Method getServerLoginByIndex to Server object
- added Parameter withoutBots to getPlayerCount (default on true)
- added some missing PHP Docs
- added some depency libraries as they are used by the Socket Handler
- updated some depency libraries
