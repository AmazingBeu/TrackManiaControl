## WINDOWS:

- ManiaControl is mainly tested on UNIX machines.
- Even though it might run properly on Windows we can't promise it will work in all cases.
- In order to run ManiaControl on Windows you have to alter the file 'ManiaControl.bat' and enter the path to your php.exe!


## REQUIREMENTS:
- MySQL Database
- PHP 5.4+
- Needed extensions (on ManiaControl startup you will see if you have them activated):
	- php_mysqli
	- php_curl
	- php_xmlrpc (TM only, recomended for SM)
